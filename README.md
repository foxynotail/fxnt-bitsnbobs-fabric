This mod is from FoxyNoTail's FXNT Create Let's Play. 
It features a handful of new blocks as well as a bunch of new recipes for the Create Mod.

All blocks are compatible with Framed Blocks and can be picked up with the Create Wrench.

Recipes and Netherite Dust require the Create Mod although those mods are not necessary for the other blocks.
